     * R.id.bible_markov_fragment_progress, our [RecyclerView] field [mRecyclerView] by finding the

     * method of our [Markov] field [mMarkov] and we initialize our [MarkovAdapter] field [mAdapter]
     * with an instance of [MarkovAdapter] constructed to use our [Markov] field [mMarkov] as its
     * data generator and our [RecyclerView.LayoutManager] field [mLayoutManager] as its `LayoutManager`.

     * [mLayoutManager]. We set the `OnClickListener` of [mProgressBar] to a lambda which will switch
     * the switch the visibility of [mProgressBar] to INVISIBLE, switch the visibility of [mRecyclerView]

     * [mMarkov] can just call the `callOnClick` method of [mProgressBar] when it is done loading the
     * Markov state table in order to switch from the `ProgressBar` to the `RecyclerView`). Finally
